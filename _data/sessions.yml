  title: "Material Design Everywhere using the Android Support Libraries"
  description: "Android 5.0 was one of the more exciting releases ever - especially with the introduction of the Material design. The specifications describe a beautiful UI, that can be a challenging for developers to implement, particularly if they must support backwards compatibility.\n\nIt just became easier with the release of the 'Android Design Support Library' (and the previously released 'AppCompat Library'). Developers now have the tools that make it simple to create Material compliant apps - that will work and look great on almost all devices (even ones running 2.1).\n\nIn this presentation I will highlight some important components of these libraries, and demonstrate how to use them effectively.\n\nIt is just the beginning for Material design - come learn about the important tools that make it easy to be part of the revolution."

  title: "Android TDD"
  description: "There's no reason why Agile practices and Android can't go hand in hand. In this session, learn how to add TDD (test-driven development) to your next Android project. Thankfully, you no longer have to rely on Google's jUnit3 testing framework now that Google have rolled out jUnit4 testing in Android Studio. The class begins with how to set up Android Studio to do unit tests and mocking. We then move on to use unit testing to create a sample app to show best practices for creating a test-driven environment."

  description: "This workshop will focus on Lean Startup emergent practices on how to validate features or product ideas before writing a single line of code, to make sure you're building the right thing. In this session, we will review customer development techniques as you go from user interviews to prototypes to code. We'll dive deeply into prototyping techniques and a build-measure-learn cycle that minimizes wasted effort building the wrong product. We'll also discuss how to use this process to acquire your early customers. Whether you're a beginner, novice or master developer, you'll be able to put the techniques you learn into practice first thing Monday morning, to make sure you're building an app or product that people will be passionate about using."

The realtime aspect of the database, and the ease of implementation make it a great tool to teach client-side web apps. Though it does have a full sdk for iOS and Android. It is also so fast and easy to setup it is more often my first choice for proof of concept ideas within our department. I will walk through an overview of what the technology is, why it has become my goto for most new projects and even do short demo to exemplify why it is so easy."
